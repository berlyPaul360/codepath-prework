**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Berly Paul**

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/~berly-light-and-memory-game)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- I can set up a score for updating the amount of wins and losses
- I can also style the game a little better
- I can also randomize the sequences a little more

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I used the chrome developers tools to inpect the code to help me find any errors]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The most challenging part was actually getting the syntax right because I typed everything in an effort to understand the code. I overcame through the MDN website and looking at the developers tool 
on chrome. So in essence the Mozzilla website coupled with the developers tool on chrome helped out with any errors. Other things I encountered was making sure that all my variables were initialized 
I noticed most of my issues were due failure of initializing a variable. Some of the other issues I had with the code included the logic portion. Using the conditional statements to check all possible conditions
of winning and losing.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Questions I have relating to web development are how would I turn this game into an app? How can I randomize this game a little more? What frameworks would increase more interaction and available features?
In a time of word press and a lot of auto generated websites, what are the prospects of a web developer? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would style this project a little better. I'd definitly increase the look of the buttons. Add a more modern looking feel such as a nav-bar. I would definitley add more randomization in the 
play sequence. I'd add a score keeper section or some type of motivational messageing, letting the user know they are on the right track. The messageing ssytem would be funny and youthful.
